# NoSql Social Network API

## Description

I created this app in the Rice University bootcamp. In the walkthrough it demonstates routes for users, thought, reactions, and friends. You will find in the walkthrough that I can create, find all, find by id, update, and delete users and thoughts. I also create, and delete reactions and friends.

Here is the link to the walkthrough of the routes demanstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQ-qxtz786bN6N68njuDYhMkF7RnjEp_/view
